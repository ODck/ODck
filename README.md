Hello there! 👋

I'm ODck, a game developer and full-stack engineer with a passion for creating awesome experiences and writing clean, maintainable code. 💻

🎮 Game Development
---------------

I've spent countless hours honing my skills in game development, specializing in Unity and more recently, Godot. Whether it's crafting 2D puzzle games or 3D open-world adventures, I love bringing ideas to life and pushing the limits of what's possible. 🚀

🤖 Full Stack
-----------

When I'm not busy building games, I enjoy dabbling in full-stack development. I'm proficient in C#, .NET, JavaScript, and other programming languages. From back-end APIs to front-end interfaces, I can handle it all. 💪

🌐 Vue.js
-------

One thing I can't get enough of is Vue.js. There's something about its simplicity and flexibility that makes it a joy to work with. If you need someone to geek out with about Vue, I'm your guy! 😄

📝 Clean Code
----------

Clean, readable code is my jam. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of refactoring a messy function into a beautiful, elegant solution. 🧹‍♂️
